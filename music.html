                <p class="montserrat-light">
                    James Ellercamp is a multi-instrumentalist with formal
                    training as a screen composer. Born in Sydney, Australia, he
                    traveled the world teaching music before settling down in
                    Canada with his family. A member of the Screen Composers
                    Guild of Canada, his work as a composer and music producer
                    has been featured in games, podcasts, and film.
                </p>
                <p class="montserrat-light">
                    After receiving his Bachelor of Music in contemporary
                    performance from the Australian Institute of Music, James
                    went on to study screen music at the Australian Film
                    Television and Radio School. He first moved to Canada in
                    2018 where he did freelance composition work for ad agencies
                    and immersed himself in Toronto’s vibrant music scene with
                    featured performances in prominent open mic series.
                </p>
                <p class="montserrat-light">
                    He also worked with local nonprofits, including a 2019
                    campaign for the 30th anniversary of Toronto’s Word On The
                    Street book festival that featured beloved Canadian
                    children’s music performers Sharon & Bram.

                <p class="montserrat-light">
                    During the global COVID-19 pandemic, James produced a lo-fi,
                    ambient EP under his side project, GAL. Returning to Sydney
                    for a year, he worked as a session musician and producer for
                    local bands. He collaborated with Canadian author Rebecca
                    Diem on “Lighthouse,” an audio-visual project funded through
                    the CBC Digital Originals program and the Canada Council for
                    the Arts.

                <p class="montserrat-light">
                    James also furthered his education, pursuing independent
                    study in coding followed by an immersive web development
                    bootcamp at Juno College of Technology upon his return to
                    Canada. He began working at STREAMSIX in 2022, initially as
                    a web developer before moving into games. He is the composer
                    for the forthcoming STREAMSIX release Leviathan: Streams of
                    Legends.

                <p class="montserrat-light">
                    In 2022-2023, James also continued his work with long-time
                    collaborator (& now wife) Rebecca Diem as the music producer
                    and sound designer for two seasons of the acclaimed Read the
                    North podcast, showcasing his adaptive style with original
                    compositions across multiple genres.

                <p class="montserrat-light">
                    In 2023 he began work on his debut feature-length film
                    project with writer-director Jason Krawczyk as the screen
                    composer for “Sunset Superman” (U.S. title: “Don’t Mess With
                    Grandma”), which premiered at Fantastic Fest in 2024. Read more <a href="https://thegeekshow.co.uk/sunset-superman-fantastic-fest-2024/" target="_blank">here</a>.
